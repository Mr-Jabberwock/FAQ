                "Additionally at the bottom of the page your name will be added to a series of lines. These are the 'punched in' employees and you see their name and their 'punch in' time in this line. As an admin, you also have the possibility to 'punch out' an employee. This is in case they forgot to punch themselves out or in case something else of that sort goes wrong. The salary type toggle makes it possible for you to toggle your own or someone else's salary between being on commision or being on an hourly rate. The 'Punch Clock' list on the top right side indicates your 10 most recent 'punch outs'. The most recent one will be at the top. Furthermore you can search for the names of people who are 'punched in' in the search bar."
